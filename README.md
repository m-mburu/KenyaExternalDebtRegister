  public debt register data set.

  Python/extract_data.py
- Extracted historical exchange rates data set from the
  <https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd>
  and saved it as a csv file. Script: Python/historical_currency_data.py
- Downloaded USD inflation data set from
  <https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1980?amount=1> to convert
  into todays equivalent dollars.
- Downloaded IMF SDR data from
  <https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx>. This will be
